1. Set your fork as a remote:

   `git remote add fork https://github.com/GITHUB_USERNAME/go-mailio-did.git`

1. Make changes (see [Formatting](#formatting) and [Style](#style)) and commit
   to your fork. Initial commit messages should follow the
   [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) style (e.g.
   `feat(functions): add gophers codelab`).
1. Send a pull request with your changes.
1. A maintainer will review the pull request and make comments. Prefer adding
   additional commits over amending and force-pushing since it can be difficult
